HarmonyEngine
=============

Cross-platform multi-threaded OpenGL renderer that combines the best open-source libraries available under one unified work flow. 

**Disclaimer:** This is a very much work in progress and not ready for public consumption.

Getting Started:
----------------
TBD

Harmony Library
---------------
Self-contained, zero dependency static library.

TBD

Editor Tool
-------------
A WYSIWYG GUI application that allows you to visually design sprite animations, fonts, particles, shaders, and more.
Or by using any combination of above, create complex animation hierarchies and apply physics.

Quickly setup new projects. Designer Tool will create and populate a new workspace containing all initially necessary assets and code projects.

TBD
