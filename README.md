HarmonyEngine
=============

Cross-platform multi-threaded engine that combines the best open-source libraries available under one unified work flow. 

**Disclaimer:** This is a very much work in progress and not ready for public consumption.

Getting Started:
----------------
1. Clone this repository
2. Download and execute the CMake Installer. Make sure to set the PATH variable during installation

Harmony Library
---------------
Self-contained, zero dependency static library.

TBD

Editor Tool
-------------
A WYSIWYG GUI application that allows you to visually design sprite animations, fonts, particles, shaders, and more.
Or by using any combination of above, create complex animation hierarchies and apply physics.

Quickly setup new projects. The Editor creates and populates a new workspace containing all initially necessary assets and code projects.

**Requires at least Qt Version 5.13.0 to compile the editor** 

TBD
