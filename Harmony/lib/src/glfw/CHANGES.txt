Preprocessor define in project: _GLFW_USE_CONFIG_H

Also glfw project itself includes its "src" path as part of the includes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
internal.h - Line 47 was changed to:
#include "GLFW/glfw3.h"

since this falls in the standard include paths

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
glfw_config.h should be edited to work with all platforms
